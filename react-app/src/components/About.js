        It was conceived by our founder Andre Grant, who himself is a fan of wine & spirits! His personal favorite being Bourbon, especially Four Roses Single Barrel. When Wine Party was conceived, it was about connection. Connecting everyday people, to exclusive and luxury experiences that most otherwise did not have access to. How many of us, have had the experience of a Sommelier, talking about and giving us true history and perspective on their favorite wine. Or perhaps learning about the history and having the live experience of a champagne sabering! This is what Wine Party is about. 
        
        Now, letâ€™s find your host!</h1></div>
