              Wine tasting can be as casual as hitting up a local winery or even
              just purchasing a few wines to try with friends at home. But if
              you want to take it up a notch and get fancy, consider hiring a
              sommelier (wine expert). Take your guests beyond a surface-level
              tasting, so they can walk away feeling confident in choosing wine
              for their next dinner party or gift purchase. Think outside of the
              box to wow your guests with your newfound wine knowledge and
              provide a high-end (and delicious) educational experience. These
              wine tasting party ideas will delight your fellow wine-lovers and
              have them begging you to throw another.

              Pairing wine with food is an art form in itself. So skip the usual
              cheese and crackers, and partner up with a local chocolate shop or
              ice cream parlor to design a wine and- dessert pairing experience
              for your party guests. Select a handful of flavors to pair with
              each wine you taste. For chocolate and wine pairing ideas, check
              out this Spruce Eats article. To match ice cream with the perfect
              wine, take a look at this Kitchen guide. Combine dessert and
              drinks all in one party so your guests won’t leave hungry.

              Wine tasting is serious business. Take your party to the next
              level and bring in a Wine Party Certified sommelier to give your
              guests the opportunity to learn the ABCs of wine. Plus, get a
              crash course in wine history and culture. How often do you get to
              say you can drink for educational purposes? You’ll come out of the
              party identifying wine flavor notes like a pro.

              from around the world! Cost Plus World Market and Total Wine &
              More are excellent places to find a wide variety of foreign wines.
              To complete the party, serve your guests an array of culturally
              diverse appetizers to go along with the theme. You just might
              discover your new favorite wine or even a wine region you would
              love to visit!

              This is one of those fun wine tasting party ideas that will turn
              an ordinary tasting event into a game! To begin, pour wine into
              glasses and hide the bottles or cover the labels. Ask each guest
              to guess the prices and/or ratings of the wine (which you can find
              on the Vivino app). Have them write their guesses on index cards
              and instruct them to keep their answers a secret. Offer a relevant
              prize, such as a wine glass and bottle stopper or a bottle of the
              top-rated wine, for the guest who guesses the most prices and
              ratings correctly.

              Grapes aren’t the only wine base. Skip the status quo and try
              wines made from tart cherries, peaches, apples, or even
              pineapples! If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, sample
              some jalapeno or rhubarb wine. This wine tasting party idea will
              set your event apart and might even help your guests discover
              their new favorite drinks. It is a perfect option if you’ve got
              some folks in your crowd who have mixed feelings about traditional
              wine but still want to join in on the experience of a drink
              tasting party.

            <span>
              Go beyond simply tasting the wine. Set up a tour at your local
              winery so your guests can learn all about the wine-making process,
              starting from the grape planting and harvesting, then ending with
              bottling and storage. Home wineries are also growing in
              popularity, so if you can’t book a winery, find a friend who owns
              a DIY winery and ask them if they’d be willing to have an open
              house.

              EWineries often host great live music events, but even if you’re
              having a wine tasting party in the comfort of your own home, you
              can book a band or musician to add a special touch to the event.
              Gigsalad and The Bash are excellent resources to find local talent
              that is within your budget range. Stumped on what music genre to
              seek out? Consider jazz or soft rock to match the elegance of the
              occasion.

              Set up a TV or projector and play the 2012 wine documentary SOMM
              throughout the wine tasting party. This way, your guests can
              casually learn about what it takes to be a wine expert and
              experience a day in the life of a sommelier! It’s hard not to be
              drinking a glass while watching it anyway, so why not make it an
              event?

              Joining a monthly wine club is a big commitment. Gather friends to
              sample wines from a club you want to join so you can all make an
              informed purchase decision. Winc, VineBox, and Wine Awesomeness
              are all superb subscription-box options (VineBox even features
              mini samples!). You can also subscribe to clubs hosted by your
              favorite wineries. Consider splitting a subscription with a few
              friends for a cost-effective way to enjoy new wines on a regular
              basis.

              While a winery is an obvious choice for a wine tasting party
              venue, almost anywhere with seating and tables will work. Browse
              through Wine Party and find lofts, mansions, jazz clubs, studios,
              cafes, and even outdoor spaces like gardens where you can host
              your tasting event.Just find your Wine Party Host, bring the wine,
              glasses, napkins, and snacks, and let the venue handle the rest.
